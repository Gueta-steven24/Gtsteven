                    <p>A group of university students finds themselves trapped inside their school overnight, only to realize that a deadly game of survival has begun. One by one, their classmates fall victim to a mysterious killer lurking in the shadows. Suspicion grows, fear takes over, and trust shatters as they struggle to uncover the murderer among them.

                        But just when they think they’ve solved the puzzle, the real nightmare begins.

A battle between reality and a fractured mind unfolds, leading to a shocking revelation that will leave them questioning everything.
                        
                        Who will make it out alive? And what happens when the deadliest enemy is the one you never saw coming?

                        This is a story of resilience, hope, and the relentless pursuit of success. Watch her journey unfold. #Inspiration #HardworkPaysOff #NeverGiveUp</p>
